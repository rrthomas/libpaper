The libpaper package enables users to indicate their preferred paper
size, provides the paper utility to find the user's preferred default
paper size and give information about known sizes, and specifies
system-wide and per-user paper size catalogues (see “man paperspecs”).

See “man paper” for information about how to set the default paper size.

The libpaper package is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License, version 2.1, or, at your option, any later version, with the
exception of the files listed below; see the file COPYING.

  * The file ‘paperspecs’ is in the public domain.
  * The ‘paper’ program is distributed under the GNU General Public Licence
    version 3, or, at your option, any later version. See the file
    COPYING-GPL-3.

Libpaper was developed by Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>, based on the
design of libpaper by Yves Arrouye <yves@debian.org>, improved by
Adrian Bunk <bunk@fs.tum.de>. It also supersedes the earlier “paper”
package developed by Reuben Thomas.


Installation from source
------------------------

To build, you need a standard POSIX.1-2008 environment and C99 compiler.
Run:

  ./configure --enable-relocatable && make && [sudo] make install

The --enable-relocatable option builds libpaper as a relocatable
package that can be copied anywhere once built and installed. Note
that if you do not use it, the tests (“make check”) will not work.

For installation options, see ./configure --help; see INSTALL for more
information.


Building from git
-----------------

To build from git, you need the following extra programs installed:

  automake, autoconf, git, help2man

Then run:

  ./bootstrap

Then follow the instructions for building from source.
